    <p>I'm pursuing my masters in information systems for the Spring 2024 batch.</p>
    <p>
        I have an interest in Cloud computing, Computer Engineering, and Web Design Technologies.
        <br>Coming to experience, I completed a six-month internship at High Radius Company,
        an online internship over full-stack development.

        I did a research project "Real-time Interactive Virtual Smart Board using AI" at SRMIST from January to May 2023, under the mentorship of Dr. M. Susila. 
        We conducted extensive research on datasets, computer vision, and deep learning algorithms.
        Our application, designed for individuals with physical impairments, also transformed the teaching experience through an interactive learning platform.
        By leveraging advanced object detection algorithms and deep learning networks, our model achieved remarkable real-time fingertip recognition.
        I presented the research at the prestigious 2nd International Conference on Human-Centric Smart Computing (ICHCSC 2023).
        The research paper was published in the Smart Innovation, Systems, and Technologies book series.

    <p>My hobbies are cooking, gardening, and I would like to be a mountaineer.</p>
